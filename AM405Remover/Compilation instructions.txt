Windows:

	Install MinGW, find the g++ executable within the MinGW install folder, then edit the line:
		C:\MinGW\bin\g++.exe -o AddMusic.exe class_string.cpp class_int.cpp AddMusic.cpp
	In the included "Compile.bat" to point towards your g++ install. Execute the bat and it should compile in the same directory

Linux:

	Navigate to the folder then:
		make clean
		make
	and that should be it for that. Thank p4plus2 for making the make file.
